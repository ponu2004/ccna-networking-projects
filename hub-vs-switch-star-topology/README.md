# Hub vs Switch Communication in Star Topology

##  Description
This project shows the difference between Hub and Switch behavior in a star topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.

- Hub broadcasts data to all devices.
- Switch sends only to the destination MAC address.

##  Devices Used
- 1 Hub
- 1 Switch
- 6 PCs (3 on Hub, 3 on Switch)

## Concepts Shown
- Broadcast vs Direct forwarding
- OSI Layers (Hub: Layer 1, Switch: Layer 2)
- Collision domain (Hub: 1, Switch: separate per port)
